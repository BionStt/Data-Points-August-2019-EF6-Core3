"In this article, using the latest preview version of EF6.3 and ASP.NET Core 3.0, I’ll go all in on trying out EF6.3 in a cross-platform scenario—creating a new ASP.NET Core 3.0 API using EF6.3. On my MacBook! In macOS! Using Visual Studio Code! And then deploying it to a Linux-based Docker container! Not one of these tasks was possible with EF6 until now. You can still use EF6.3 in .NET Framework apps in Visual Studio starting with version 2017 v15.3, although for .NET Core 3.0 apps you’ll need preview versions of Visual Studio 2019 that support .NET Core 3.0."
